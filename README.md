Adaptive randomization often requires continuous update of infromation between personels who provide the clinical information and who perform the randomization. To reduce the requirements of continuous data update among different units and minimize man-made errors during the process, the BayCAR randomization method is developed into a Shiny application. Meanwhile, a REDCap API is useed to streamline data input, output to achieve minimal involvement randomization. By clicking on an desktop icon, and the clinic data can be uploaded, and new subject(s) can be randomized automatically.
